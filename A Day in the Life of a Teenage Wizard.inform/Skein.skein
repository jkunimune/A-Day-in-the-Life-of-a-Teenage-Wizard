You&apos;re practically ripping out your hair from stress.  Today is the date of the school dance, which you still don&apos;t have a date for.  To make matters worse, there&apos;s the major chemistry exam worth 40% of your grade that you haven&apos;t studied for yet.  On top of that, you&apos;re already late for school.  Oh, yeah, and you&apos;re locked in the basement.

A Day in the Life of a Teenage Wizard
Ordinary Problems, Magical Solutions by Justin Kunimune
Release 1 / Serial number 131009 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Basement
The basement is a dark and dank area.  It is small; the only things here are an old chest and some wooden stairs leading up to an unlocked door.  You don&apos;t know how you managed to lock yourself in when you came down to get your book, but the important thing is the bus leaves in 10 minutes, so you&apos;d better get out of here soon.

You can see a chest (closed) here.

You pull out a donut and hand it to him.  His eyes widen.
&quot;You can only have it if you let me in,&quot; you say alluringly.
&quot;Deal!&quot; he exlaims without hesitation.  &quot;They&apos;re only paying me fifty bucks, anyway.&quot;

The guard steps aside to let you through.

Quad
The quad is a great grassy square with the computer lab to the west, the science building to the north, the school gym to the east, and the road to the south.  The Math, English, Social Studies, and Language buildings are behind the science building, but you don&apos;t have any of those classes today.

You can see a flowers and a hooded man here.
