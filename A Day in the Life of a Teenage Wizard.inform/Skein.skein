You&apos;re practically ripping out your hair from stress.  Today is the date of the school dance, which you still don&apos;t have a date for.  To make matters worse, there&apos;s the major chemistry exam worth 40% of your grade that you haven&apos;t studied for yet.  On top of that, you&apos;re already late for school.  Oh, yeah, and you&apos;re locked in the basement.

A Day in the Life of a Teenage Wizard
Ordinary Problems, Magical Solutions by Justin Kunimune
Release 1 / Serial number 131015 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Basement
The basement is a dark and dank area.  It is small; the only things here are an old chest and some wooden stairs leading up to an unlocked door.  You don&apos;t know how you managed to lock yourself in when you came down to get your book, but the important thing is the bus leaves in 10 minutes, so you&apos;d better get out of here soon.

You can see a chest (closed) here.

&quot;Good morning, class,&quot; the teacher says, &quot;Today, we will be working on our text-adventure games…&quot;

&quot;Remember, games are due next class,&quot; the teacher concludes.  Everyone begins to pack up their backpacks and leave.  Jane is leaving, too.  You have to stop her so you can ask her to the dance!

Computer Lab
The computer lab is a small, square-shaped room with rows of desks facing the northern wall.  Each desk has a computer on it.

You can see Jane here.
