You&apos;re practically ripping out your hair from stress.  Today is the date of the school dance, which you still don&apos;t have a date for.  To make matters worse, there&apos;s the major chemistry exam worth 40% of your grade that you haven&apos;t studied for yet.  On top of that, you&apos;re already late for school.  Oh, yeah, and you&apos;re locked in the basement.

A Day in the Life of a Teenage Wizard
Ordinary Problems, Magical Solutions by Justin Kunimune
Release 1 / Serial number 131018 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Basement
The basement is a dark and dank area.  It is small; the only things here are an old chest and some wooden stairs leading up to a locked door.  You don&apos;t know how you managed to lock yourself in when you came down to get your book, but the important thing is the bus leaves soon, so you&apos;d better get out of here soon.

You can see a chest (closed) here.

Through the window, you notice Mr Lacimec&apos;s briefcase magicly unlatch itself and fall open.  Papers from within the briefcase go flying everywhere.
The test paper immediately get soaked by the rain.  When Mr Lacimec gets to the classroom, he is not happy.  The entire class spends the rest of class sitting in the corner.  At least you&apos;re not failing.
By the time class is over, the sun is beginning to set, and it is late in the day.  It&apos;s time to go to the dance with Jane.  She should be waiting at the gym right now.

Quad
The quad is a great grassy square with the computer lab to the west, the science building to the north, the school gym to the east, and the road to the south.  Students are bustling all over the place.  It is raining hard.

You can see a hooded man here.

By the time you wake up, it is well into the dance.  Jane probably is wondering where you are.  You need to get in there now!

Gym
The gym is a large building with high windows.  As you approach it from the west, you can already hear loud music coming out and lights flashing from inside.  You try to enter, but a large guard blocks your path.

You can see a guard here.

Then, a boy comes over, pushes you apart, and yells at you.  You can&apos;t hear him, either, but it seems to be something along the lines of &quot;That&apos;s my girlfriend.&quot;
Suddenly, you recognize him as the guy who won the world boxing championships last year.  Uh-oh.
