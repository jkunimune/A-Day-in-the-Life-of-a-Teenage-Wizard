You&apos;re practically ripping out your hair from stress.  Today is the date of the school dance, which you still don&apos;t have a date for.  To make matters worse, there&apos;s the major chemistry exam worth 40% of your grade that you haven&apos;t studied for yet.  On top of that, you&apos;re already late for school.  Oh, yeah, and you&apos;re locked in the basement.

A Day in the Life of a Teenage Wizard
Ordinary Problems, Magical Solutions by Justin Kunimune
Release 1 / Serial number 131018 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Basement
The basement is a dark and dank area.  It is small; the only things here are an old chest and some wooden stairs leading up to a locked door.  You don&apos;t know how you managed to lock yourself in when you came down to get your book, but the important thing is the bus leaves soon, so you&apos;d better get out of here soon.

You can see a chest (closed) here.

By the time you wake up, it is well into the dance.  Jane probably is wondering where you are.  You need to get in there now!

Gym
The gym is a large building with high windows.  As you approach it from the west, you can already hear loud music coming out and lights flashing from inside.  You try to enter, but a large guard blocks your path.

You get on the bus and sit in the back.  Before you know it, you are getting off at the entrance to school.

School Entrance
The entrance to school is just a parking lot with a sign stating the name of your school.  The rest of your classmates are already entering the quad.  You see Jane among them.  You have to catch up to her and ask her to the dance tonight before someone else does.  The quad is just to the north.

Quad
The quad is a great grassy square with the computer lab to the west, the science building to the north, the school gym to the east, and the parking lot to the south.  Students are bustling all over the place.  The Math, English, Social Studies, and Language buildings are behind the science building, but you don&apos;t have any of those classes today.  You see Jane walking into the computer lab.  You both have computer science there in ten minutes.

You can see a flowers and a hooded man here.

You step into the computer lab just as class begins.  Jane, your crush, is already sitting down.
&quot;Good morning, class,&quot; the teacher says, &quot;Today, we will be working on our text-adventure games.&quot;

&quot;Remember, games are due next class,&quot; the teacher concludes.  Everyone begins to pack up their backpacks and leave.  Jane is leaving, too.  You have to stop her so you can ask her to the dance!

&quot;It&apos;s amazing if you think about it,&quot; she continues, &quot;Tons and tons of liquid water rushing down from the sky and flowing down rivers.&quot;

Her words painfully remind you that you have to pee.

You really need to go to the bathroom.

&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; you stammer, &quot;I was just… I wanted to…&quot;
You can&apos;t quite remember your train of thought.  This isn&apos;t good.  You&apos;re looking bad in front of Jane.  You start sweating violently.  Also not good.
&quot;Is is hot in here, or is it just me?&quot; you ask.
&quot;I have some water, if you want,&quot; offers Jane.

She pulls a water bottle out of her backpack and hands it to you.  You waterfall a sizable gulp, into your mouth, much to your bladder&apos;s protest.

You bounce up and down nervously.  You can&apos;t hold it much longer.

&quot;So, there&apos;s the dance tonight…&quot; you begin uneasily.
&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; Jane says, &quot;Did you know the theme is underwater?

Waterfalls are not fun to think about when you have to pee.

You can&apos;t hold it any longer!  You run to the bathroom without hesitation.  How embarrassing.

Just another day in the life of a teenage wizard.
