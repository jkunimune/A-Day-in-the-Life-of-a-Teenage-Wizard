You&apos;re practically ripping out your hair from stress.  Today is the date of the school dance, which you still don&apos;t have a date for.  To make matters worse, there&apos;s the major chemistry exam worth 40% of your grade that you haven&apos;t studied for yet.  On top of that, you&apos;re already late for school.  Oh, yeah, and you&apos;re locked in the basement.

A Day in the Life of a Teenage Wizard
Ordinary Problems, Magical Solutions by Justin Kunimune
Release 1 / Serial number 131013 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Basement
The basement is a dark and dank area.  It is small; the only things here are an old chest and some wooden stairs leading up to an unlocked door.  You don&apos;t know how you managed to lock yourself in when you came down to get your book, but the important thing is the bus leaves in 10 minutes, so you&apos;d better get out of here soon.

You can see a chest (closed) here.
